q1.c takes an input file from the command line, inverts the case of each alphabet and reverses the content! It saves this in a new file 'output.txt' in a new directory 'Assignment'. 
To compile: gcc q1.c
To execute: ./a.out [input filename]

q2.c then creates a symlink, checks whether the output file has been correctly generated and gives information about the permissions of the directory and the file. 
To compile: gcc q2.c
To execute: ./a.out [input filename]
